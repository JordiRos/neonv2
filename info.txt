What you will need to compile:

- VS2005
- DirectX9 SDK
- PlatformSDK for dshow
- Boost (I use version 1.33.1)
- Lua 5.1 (rar included) for neon player
- Max SDK for 3d object plugin exporter
- Freeframe SDK for filter freeframe
- QT Sdk or something (I don't remember) if you plan to include MovPlayer,
  but it's slow and I won't recommend it
  
Included and used:  
- FFmpeg .lib, .h, .dll
- BASS .lib, .h, .dll
- TinyXML .lib, .h

I think that's all. Have fun! If you make something with it, drop me a line

More info:
--------------------
There are some files in Effects and Filters directory. Those are effects
and filters used in original neon v2, and need to be translated to v2.5
(new features and syntaxis)
I left them because maybe someone will translate them
