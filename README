Neon v2 was a VJ I developed in the early 2000's for small VJ parties and some demoscene productions.
It's deprecated now

What you will need to compile:

- VS2005
- DirectX9 SDK
- PlatformSDK for dshow
- Boost 1.33.1
- Lua 5.1 for neon player
- Freeframe SDK for filter freeframe
- Max SDK for 3d object plugin exporter (not included)
- QT Sdk if you plan to include MovPlayer,  but it's slow and I won't recommend it
  
Included and used:  
- FFmpeg .lib, .h, .dll
- BASS .lib, .h, .dll
- TinyXML .lib, .h
